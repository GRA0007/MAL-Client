# MAL Client for Pebble
An unofficial MyAnimeList Client for the Pebble smartwatch.

So, basically, this watchapp will allow you to check your anime/manga list and update the episodes or status all from your watch. You will also be able to view information for an anime/manga and in the future, view the cover art for that anime/manga on your watch. You will also be able to view your friends and browse top anime/manga and add them to your list.

I have based this watchapp off the android app 'Pocket MAL', which is a great unofficial MAL Client for android. You can view this app [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.g.pocketmal&hl=en).
